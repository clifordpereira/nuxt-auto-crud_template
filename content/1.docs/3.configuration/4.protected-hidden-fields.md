title: Field Privacy & Protection
description: Technical specification for protected (read-only) and hidden (server-side only) fields within the nuxt-auto-crud engine.
summary: This guide defines the security boundaries for database fields. Agents and clients are restricted from writing to protected fields and reading from hidden fields, ensuring data integrity and security.
---

The `nuxt-auto-crud` engine enforces strict security boundaries by automatically filtering fields during CRUD operations.

## 🛡️ Protected Fields (Write-Only)
Protected fields are system-managed and cannot be updated via the generic CRUD endpoints. The engine automatically strips these from incoming payloads.

**Default Protected Fields:**
- **Primary Keys:** `id`
- **Timestamps:** `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `deletedAt`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at`
- **Audit Trails:** `createdBy`, `updatedBy`, `deletedBy`, `created_by`, `updated_by`, `deleted_by`

## 🔒 Hidden Fields (Read-Prevention)
Hidden fields are stripped from all API responses (both `GET` list and `GET` single) to prevent sensitive data leakage.

**Default Hidden Fields:**
- **Authentication:** `password`, `resetToken`, `githubId`, `googleId` (and snake_case variants)
- **Security:** `secret`, `token`
- **System Leakage:** `deletedAt`, `createdBy`, `updatedBy`, etc.

## 🛠 Customization
Custom field sets can be defined per-model within the `modelMapper.ts` utility using `customUpdatableFields` and `customHiddenFields`.
