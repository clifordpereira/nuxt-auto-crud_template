title: Resource Configuration (RBAC)
description: Define fine-grained access control and resource policies.

## Overview

You can define fine-grained access control and resource policies in your `nuxt.config.ts` under the `autoCrud` key.

## Example Configuration

```typescript
// nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  autoCrud: {
    resources: {
      // Guest View: Only these columns are visible to unauthenticated users.
      // Access control (who can list/read) is managed by your DB permissions.
      users: ['id', 'name', 'avatar'], 
    },
  },
})
```

## Advanced Field Visibility

Currently, `nuxt-auto-crud` simplifies visibility into two tiers:
1.  **Guest (Unauthenticated)**: Restricted by `publicColumns`.
2.  **Authenticated (All Roles)**: Sees all fields (except globally hidden ones like `password`).

**Industry Standard for Granular Control:**
In enterprise applications requiring role-specific field visibility (e.g., "Managers" see salary, "Employees" do not), the standard approach is **Field-Level Security (FLS)** stored in the database or handled via **API Resources/Transformers** in code. 

As `nuxt-auto-crud` focuses on MVP speed and simplicity, role-specific field filtering is currently out of scope for the configuration file. If you require this level of granularity, we recommend:
- Creating a custom API endpoint for that specific view.
- Contributing to the project to add DB-based Field Permissions.

## Security Note

Even in full-stack applications where you control the UI, relying on the frontend to "not display" sensitive data is a security vulnerability. The data is still visible in the browser's Network tab. 

*   **Global Hiding:** Fields like `password`, `secret`, and `token` are automatically hidden from **ALL** responses by default.
*   **Context Hiding:** Use the `resources` config (as shown above) to filter other semi-sensitive fields (like `email` or `phone`) specifically from public guest responses.
