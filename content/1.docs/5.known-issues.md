## Foreign Key Naming

- **Foreign Key Naming:** Currently, if you have multiple foreign keys referring to the same table (e.g., `customer_id` and `author_id` both referring to the `users` table), the automatic relation handling might assume `user_id` for both. This is a known limitation in the current alpha version.
