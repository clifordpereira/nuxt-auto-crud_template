description: How to optimize Nuxt Auto CRUD for AI-assisted development using the Model Context Protocol.
---

This template is built to be "Agent-First." By utilizing the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, AI agents can understand and interact with your application with minimal context ingestion.

### The Agentic Toolkit

These MCP servers are highly useful and highly recommended for a smooth development experience. Adding them to your AI configuration allows the assistant to understand your project's unique structure in real-time.

To get started, simply copy and paste the `mcp_config.json` provided below into your local configuration file (e.g., `~/.gemini/antigravity/mcp_config.json` for Antigravity users).

### Sample `mcp_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nuxt": {
      "serverUrl": "https://nuxt.com/mcp"
    },
    "nuxt-ui": {
      "serverUrl": "https://ui.nuxt.com/mcp"
    },
    "nac-schema-inspector": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-server-fetch-typescript"
      ],
      "env": {
        "ALLOWED_URLS": "[\"http://localhost:3000/api/_meta?format=md&token=YOUR_ENCODED_TOKEN\"]"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 1. nuxt (Framework Intelligence)
Provides deep, real-time knowledge of the Nuxt 4 ecosystem.
- **Role**: Direct access to Nuxt documentation, modules, and architectural patterns.
- **Workflow**: Agents use this to verify auto-imports, Nitro routes, and `app/` directory conventions.
- **Benefit**: Guarantees that your code is performant and follows modern Nuxt standards.

### 2. nuxt-ui (Design Logic)
Essential for maintaining the premium aesthetics of the template.
- **Role**: Accesses Nuxt UI 4 component specifications and examples.
- **Workflow**: Agents retrieve `U-` component metadata to build sophisticated, consistent interfaces.
- **Benefit**: Eliminates the need for manual styling by leveraging the built-in design system.

### 3. nac-schema-inspector (Discovery)
Since `nuxt-auto-crud` is a headless engine driven by runtime reflection, traditional source code analysis isn't enough for AI. This server acts as the agent's "eyes" into the live system.
- **Role**: Introspects the live `/api/_meta` manifest.
- **Workflow**: Converts structured JSON metadata into readable Markdown.
- **Benefit**: Ensures the agent uses correct pluralized endpoints, accurate field names, and respects permission constraints.

## Standard Workflow

For maximum efficiency, AI agents follow this two-step loop:

1.  **Reconnaissance**: Invoke `nac-schema-inspector` to map the current data structures.
2.  **Implementation**: Leverage `nuxt` and `nuxt-ui` intelligence to write framework-native, UI-compliant code.

## Configuration & Setup

To enable this workflow, add the following to your `mcp_config.json`. **Don't forget to replace `YOUR_ENCODED_TOKEN` with your actual token from your `.env` file (see the encoding tip below).**

### 💡 Critical Tip: Token Encoding
The `NUXT_API_SECRET_TOKEN` used in the `ALLOWED_URLS` often contains a plus sign (`+`). When configuring the MCP server, you **must URI-encode** the `+` character as `%2B`. Failure to do this will result in a signature mismatch during discovery.

**Example:**
- Raw: `...token=AbC+123`
- Encoded: `...token=AbC%2B123`
