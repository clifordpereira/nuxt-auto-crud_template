# MCP Servers (Agentic Integration)

The `nuxt-auto-crud` ecosystem is designed for "Agentic First" operations. This is achieved through a two-tier MCP (Model Context Protocol) strategy that allows AI agents to discover system capabilities and execute operations without hardcoded configurations.

## 🏗️ Two-Tier Strategy

### Tier 1: Discovery (OSS Entry)
**Server:** `nac-schema-inspector` (mcp-server-fetch-typescript)

This tier is used for **Schema Awareness**. It connects to the `/_meta` endpoint of any `nuxt-auto-crud` instance to retrieve a markdown or JSON representation of the entire database schema, including pluralized endpoint mapping and field constraints.

*   **Primary Endpoint:** `/api/_meta?format=md`
*   **Purpose:** Enables the agent to "see" the database structure and understand which fields are protected, hidden, or required.

### Tier 2: Execution (Private/Premium)
**Server:** `nac-bridge`

This is the **CRUD Execution Engine**. It provides a standardized interface for agents to perform `create`, `list`, `get`, `update`, and `delete` operations directly against the engine.

*   **Capabilities:** Full internal CRUD mapping, handling of pluralized routes, and error translation.
*   **Security:** Inherits the engine's security boundaries (Protected/Hidden fields).

## 🔄 Recommended Workflow

For maximum reliability, AI agents should follow this sequence:

1.  **Discovery:** Invoke `nac-schema-inspector` to fetch the current schema metadata.
2.  **Analysis:** Reason about the required payload and appropriate endpoint based on the meta-data retrieved.
3.  **Execution:** Use `nac-bridge` to perform the operation with schema-accurate payloads.

## 🔐 Configuration & Secrets

When configuring MCP servers in a local environment (e.g., `mcp_config.json`), ensure that special characters in tokens are handled correctly:

*   **URI Encoding:** The plus sign (`+`) in `NUXT_API_SECRET_TOKEN` query params must be encoded as `%2B` to prevent signature mismatches during authentication.
