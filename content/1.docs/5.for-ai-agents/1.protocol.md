description: Specification for client-server interaction within the nuxt-auto-crud module.
summary: This document outlines the API protocol for interacting with the dynamic CRUD endpoints. External agents should follow the recommended querying patterns to ensure performance and compatibility.

# API Communication Protocol

The `nuxt-auto-crud` engine exposes a deterministic REST API protocol. Agents and client applications should interact with these endpoints using the following standards.

## 📡 Orchestration Strategy
The core module supports server-side orchestration and schema-driven responses. AI agents should prioritize specific, targeted queries over bulk data fetching to minimize token overhead and latency. 

For autonomous agents, we recommend using our [MCP Servers](/docs/for-ai-agents/mcp-servers) for automated discovery and execution.

## 📊 Current Implementation Status
| Feature | Strategy | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Search** | Client-Side | Performed via `Object.values(row).join(' ')` in the generic table component. |
| **Pagination** | Client-Side | Current implementation handles slicing in the frontend. |
| **Sorting** | Client-Side | Metadata-driven sorting in `UTable`. |

## 🛠 Future Evolution
The protocol is evolving toward server-side search and pagination using standard query parameters:
`GET /api/:resource?q=searchterm&page=1&limit=20`
