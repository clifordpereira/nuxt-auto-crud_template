# Quick Start: Idea to Production

Follow this simple workflow to get your application up and running:

1. **Initialize:** `npx nuxi init -t gh:clifordpereira/nuxt-auto-crud_template <my-project-name>`

2. **Configure:** Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and set your Admin email & password.

3. **Schema:** Create your Drizzle schema in `server/db/schema` (AI tools like ChatGPT or Gemini can help!) and export them in `server/db/index.ts`.

4. **Permissions:** Log in as Admin and configure your resource permissions via the dashboard.

5. **Deploy:** Deploy to your preferred provider (NuxtHub is recommended).

> **Note:** You will need to configure permissions again on your production database.

We provide paid support for deployment assistance and consultation if you need it.
