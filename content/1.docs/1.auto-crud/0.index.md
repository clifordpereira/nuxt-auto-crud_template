## The Easiest Way to Integrate Auto Crud into Your Nuxt.js Application

### 1. Install the Template

```bash
npx nuxi init -t gh:clifordpereira/nuxt-auto-crud_template <project-name>
```

### 2. Or clone the template repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clifordpereira/nuxt-auto-crud_template.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd nuxt-auto-crud_template
```

Install dependencies:

::code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm install
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn install
```

```bash [npm]
npm install
```

```bash [bun]
bun install
```

::

Nb: Remember to change the remote url by

```bash
git remote set-url origin <your-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
```

## Migrate Schemas

Define schemas in `server/database/schema.ts` and run:

::code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm run db:generate
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn run db:generate
```

```bash [npm]
npm run db:generate
```

```bash [bun]
bun run db:generate
```

::

### Start the application
::code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm run dev
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn run dev
```

```bash [npm]
npm run dev
```

```bash [bun]
bun run dev
```

::
The application will start at http://localhost:3000.


Your [RESTful CRUD endpoints](/docs/what-you-get) will then be ready.
