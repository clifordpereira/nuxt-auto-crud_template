# Core Engine Features

## 📡 Dynamic API Mapping & Agentic Tools
Leverage **Nitro Dynamic Routing** and **Runtime Reflection** to resolve RESTful endpoints directly from your Drizzle schemas. By bypassing traditional code generation, the API stays synchronized with your database layer—making it natively compatible with **LLM Tooling** and **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** agents.

| Method | Endpoint Path | Runtime Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GET** | `/api/:resource` | Dynamic pagination, and search. |
| **POST** | `/api/:resource` | Automated Zod-backed payload validation and insertion. |
| **GET** | `/api/:resource/:id` | Precision record resolution via schema metadata. |
| **PATCH** | `/api/:resource/:id` | Partial updates with strict system-field protection. |
| **DELETE** | `/api/:resource/:id` | Validated record removal |

## 🔐 Auth & RBAC
- **Authentication**: Production-ready flows for Login/Registration, Social OAuth (Google/GitHub), and Secure Password Resets.
- **Authorization**: Fine-grained **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** defined via database state and `app.config.ts` seeding, ensuring multi-instance security.

## 🖥️ Adaptive Headless UI Components
- **Dynamic Data Tables**: High-performance grids featuring **Search**, **Pagination**, and **Multi-format Export** (Excel/PDF).
- **Inferred Forms**: UI inputs are derived from Drizzle schema types, ensuring zero-drift between the database and the frontend.

---

## 🛡️ Data Integrity & System Security
- **Drizzle-Zod Validation**: Payloads are strictly validated at runtime against your schema definitions for type-safe operations.
- **Immutable Field Protection**: System-critical fields (`id`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `deletedAt`) are automatically shielded from external mutation by the NAC core.
- **Delete Logic**: Standard Hard-Deletes. System fields are recognized and protected from client-side manipulation to maintain audit trail integrity.

## ⚙️ Centralized Instance Configuration
Manage global behavior or per-resource overrides via `app.config.ts`. This architecture allows the specific App to seamlessly customize.

```ts
// app.config.ts - Centralized CRUD Governance
export default defineAppConfig({
  crud: {
    // Automated Role Seeding on deployment
    rolesToSeed: ['moderator', 'customer'],
    
    // Global Runtime Visibility Controls
    globalHide: ['updatedAt', 'deletedAt', 'createdBy', 'updatedBy'],

    exports: {
      pdf: {
        globalExclude: ['avatar', 'resetToken'],
        resourceExclude: {
          users: ['password', 'googleId'],
        },
      },
      excel: {
        globalExclude: [],
        resourceExclude: {
          users: ['password'],
        },
      },
    },
  },
})
