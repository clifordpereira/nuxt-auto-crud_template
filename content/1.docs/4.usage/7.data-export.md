Nuxt Auto CRUD provides built-in support for exporting table data to Excel and PDF.

## Features

- **Excel Export**: Generates a `.xlsx` file using the `xlsx` library.
- **PDF Export**: Generates a professional PDF document using `jspdf` and `jspdf-autotable`.
- **Dynamic Columns**: Only exports columns visible in the UI.
- **Resolved Values**: Exports human-readable values for relations (e.g., name instead of ID).

## Usage

In any Auto CRUD table, click the **Export** button to see the available formats:

1. **Excel**: Best for data analysis and importing into other tools.
2. **PDF**: Best for reporting and sharing. The PDF export includes:
    - Custom title based on the resource name.
    - Generation timestamp.
    - Professional styling with slate-themed headers.
    - Page numbering and confidentiality footer.

## Customization

The export logic is encapsulated in the `useExport` composable. You can find it at `app/composables/useExport.ts`.

### Modifying PDF Styles

You can adjust the PDF appearance by modifying the `exportToPDF` function:

```typescript
// app/composables/useExport.ts
autoTable(doc, {
  headStyles: { 
    fillColor: [51, 65, 85], // Slate 700
    // ...
  },
  // ...
})
```

### Server-Side Performance

To keep the server bundle lean and avoid compatibility issues on platforms like Cloudflare Workers, export libraries are loaded dynamically on the client side only.

```typescript
const { jsPDF } = await import('jspdf')
const { default: autoTable } = await import('jspdf-autotable')
```
