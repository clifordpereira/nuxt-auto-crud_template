# Deploying to Production

Since Nuxt Auto CRUD is built on standard Nuxt and NuxtHub practices, you can deploy it to any provider that supports Nuxt. However, **NuxtHub** is the recommended platform for the easiest experience with the database.

## 1. Environment Variables

Ensure you set the following environment variables in your production environment (e.g., via the NuxtHub dashboard or your provider's settings):

- **`NUXT_SESSION_PASSWORD`**: A long, random string (at least 32 characters) used to encrypt user sessions.
- **`NUXT_ADMIN_EMAIL`**: The email address of the initial admin user. This is used for seeding the first admin account.
- **`NUXT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`**: The initial password for the admin account.
- **`NUXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`**: Your production URL (e.g., `https://my-app.nuxt.dev`). Required for generating correct absolute URLs (e.g., for Open Graph images and password resets).
- **`NUXT_OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`** & **`NUXT_OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`**: (Optional) For GitHub Login.
- **`NUXT_OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`** & **`NUXT_OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`**: (Optional) For Google Login.
- **`NUXT_EMAIL_FROM`**: The sender address for emails (e.g., `"Auth" <noreply@example.com>`).
- **`NUXT_RESEND_API_KEY`**: (Optional) Your Resend API key for sending production emails.

## 2. Database Migrations and Seeding

Your production database permissions start empty.

The system is designed to **auto-seed** the essential data (like the default Admin role and user) **the first time you log in** with the Admin credentials configured in your environment variables.

1.  Access your deployed application's login page.
2.  Log in using the email and password you set in `NUXT_ADMIN_EMAIL` and `NUXT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
3.  The system will detect this first login and initialize the database tables with the necessary Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) structure.

## 3. Configure Permissions (Important!)

**Crucial Step:** Your local SQLite database (where you configured roles and permissions) is **NOT** uploaded to production.

Once you have logged in as Admin (which triggers the seeding):

1.  Navigate to the **Dashboard**.
2.  Go to the **Roles & Permissions** section.
3.  **Re-configure your permissions.** You need to define which roles can access which resources again for the production environment.
