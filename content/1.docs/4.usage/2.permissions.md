description: Learn how to manage permissions using the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system.
---

To manage permissions in your application, you don't need to touch the code structure. Instead, you simply add or modify records in specific database tables. The system uses a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** model.

## Core Concepts

*   **Users**: The actual people logging in.
*   **Roles**: Labels like "Admin", "Manager", or "Support" that group users together.
*   **Resources**: The parts of your application you want to protect (e.g., "users", "tickets", "products").
*   **Permissions**: The specific actions allowed (e.g., "create", "read", "update", "delete", "list").

## How to Manage Access (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Create a New Role
If you need a new type of user (e.g., "Editor"), you simply add a row to the **`roles`** table.
*   **Table**: `roles`
*   **Action**: Insert a new record.
*   **Example**: Name = "Editor"

### 2. Define a Resource
If you create a new feature (e.g., a "Blog"), you need to register it as a resource.
*   **Table**: `resources`
*   **Action**: Insert a new record.
*   **Example**: Name = "blog_posts"

### 3. Grant Permissions (The "Rule Book")
This is the most important part. To say "Editors can update blog posts", you link the three concepts together in the **`role_resource_permissions`** table.
*   **Table**: `role_resource_permissions`
*   **Action**: Insert a record linking the IDs of:
    1.  **Role**: (e.g., ID for "Editor")
    2.  **Resource**: (e.g., ID for "blog_posts")
    3.  **Permission**: (e.g., ID for "update")

*You repeat this for every action you want to allow (e.g., one row for "read", another for "create").*

### 4. Assign a Role to a User
Finally, to give a user these powers, you just assign them the role.
*   **Table**: `users`
*   **Action**: Select the Role for a specific user.
*   **Example**: Select "Editor" for user "john@example.com".

## Summary of Tables

| Table Name | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`roles`** | Define *who* exists (Admin, Guest, etc.). |
| **`resources`** | Define *what* exists (Products, Orders, etc.). |
| **`permissions`** | Define *actions* (Create, Read, Update, Delete). |
| **`role_resource_permissions`** | **The Master Switch**. Connects Role + Resource + Action. |
| **`users`** | Assigns a Role to a specific person via the `Role` field. |

## Public Access

Public (unauthenticated) access is controlled by the `public` role in the database. Assign permissions to the `public` role to allow access to resources for non-logged-in users.
