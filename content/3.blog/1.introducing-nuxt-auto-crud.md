Building modern web applications often involves a lot of repetitive work. You define your database schema, then you write API endpoints to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on that data. Then you add validation. Then you add authentication. Then you add authorization.

It's exhausted just thinking about it.

## Enter Nuxt Auto CRUD

**Nuxt Auto CRUD** is a module designed to eliminate this boilerplate. It takes your [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) schema and automatically generates fully-featured RESTful APIs.

### Key Features

- **Schema Driven**: Your database schema is the single source of truth.
- **Automatic APIs**: GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE endpoints are created instantly.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permissions for every resource and action.
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support from database to API response.
- **Zero Config**: Sensible defaults let you get started in minutes.

### How it Works

1. **Define your schema** using Drizzle ORM.
2. **Add the module** to your `nuxt.config.ts`.
3. **Start your server**. Your APIs are ready!

```typescript
// server/database/schema.ts
import { sqliteTable, text, integer } from 'drizzle-orm/sqlite-core'

export const posts = sqliteTable('posts', {
  id: integer('id').primaryKey(),
  title: text('title').notNull(),
  content: text('content').notNull(),
  published: integer('published', { mode: 'boolean' }).default(false),
})
```

With just that code, you get:
- `GET /api/posts` - List all posts (with pagination, filtering, sorting)
- `GET /api/posts/:id` - Get a single post
- `POST /api/posts` - Create a new post
- `PATCH /api/posts/:id` - Update a post
- `DELETE /api/posts/:id` - Delete a post
