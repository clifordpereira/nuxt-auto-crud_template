In the world of web development, there are many ways to build an application. Code-first, database-first, API-first. At Nuxt Auto CRUD, we believe in **Schema-First**.

## What is Schema-First?

Schema-first development means you start by defining the structure of your data. In our case, using [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) TypeScript schemas.

This schema serves as the contract for your entire application.

## Benefits

### 1. Single Source of Truth

Your schema defines your database tables, your API types, and your validation rules. Change it in one place, and it propagates everywhere.

### 2. Reduced Context Switching

You don't need to jump between SQL files, API controllers, and frontend interfaces. You define the shape of your data, and the rest follows.

### 3. Rapid Prototyping

When you don't have to write boilerplate API code, you can iterate on your data model much faster. Add a column, save the file, and your API is updated instantly.

## How Nuxt Auto CRUD Fits In

Nuxt Auto CRUD takes your Drizzle schema and treats it as the definition of your API.

- **Validation**: We infer validation rules (required fields, types, lengths) directly from the schema.
- **Documentation**: We can generate API documentation based on your schema definitions.
- **Type Safety**: The types generated by Drizzle are used to type your API responses, giving you end-to-end type safety in your Nuxt app.

Focus on your data, and let the tools handle the plumbing.
