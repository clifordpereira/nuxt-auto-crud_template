Security is paramount in any application. When exposing APIs automatically, you need a robust way to control who can access what. Nuxt Auto CRUD comes with a powerful Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system built right in.

## The RBAC Model

Our permission system is built on four core concepts:

1. **Users**: The people accessing your system.
2. **Roles**: Groups that users belong to (e.g., Admin, Manager, User).
3. **Resources**: The data entities you want to protect (e.g., Posts, Comments).
4. **Permissions**: The specific actions allowed (e.g., Create, Read, Update, Delete).

## Setting Up Permissions

Permissions are managed in the database, allowing for dynamic updates without code changes.

### 1. Define Roles

Create roles in the `roles` table.

```sql
INSERT INTO roles (name) VALUES ('admin'), ('editor'), ('viewer');
```

### 2. Assign Permissions

Link roles to resources and actions in the `role_resource_permissions` table.

- **Admin**: Can do everything on all resources.
- **Editor**: Can `create` and `update` posts, but only `read` comments.
- **Viewer**: Can only `read` posts and comments.

## Protecting Your APIs

Once configured, Nuxt Auto CRUD automatically checks permissions for every request.

- If a user tries to `DELETE /api/posts/1` but only has `read` access, they get a `403 Forbidden` response.
- If a user tries to access a resource that doesn't exist or they don't have access to, they get a `404 Not Found` or `403 Forbidden`.

## Fine-Grained Control

You can also implement row-level security and custom policies by hooking into the module's lifecycle events, ensuring that users can only edit their own data.

Secure your app with confidence using Nuxt Auto CRUD.
