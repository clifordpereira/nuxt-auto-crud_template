  title: Frequently asked questions
  description: Everything you need to know about Nuxt Auto CRUD.
  items:
    - label: Which databases are supported?
      content: We have currently tested Auto Crud with SQLite only. Support for other Drizzle ORM compatible databases will be added in future updates.
    - label: Can I create custom features?
      content: Yes! The built-in features are suitable for most data management tasks. You can leverage them for standard operations, and for things like reports or custom dashboards, we can build custom views exactly as your business needs.
    - label: How is user sign-in and security handled?
      content: We use enterprise-grade session management and secure logins. We also support multi-step verification and social logins (like Google or GitHub) to ensure your business data is only accessible by authorized users.
    - label: How do I go from idea to production?
      content: Check out our Quick Start Guide in the documentation (link in header) for a step-by-step workflow.
    - label: Can I use it with existing projects?
      content: Yes, you can add Auto Crud to any existing Nuxt project. Check out the Installation Guide in the documentation (link in header) to get started.
    - label: Do you charge for development?
      content: No. Our managed plans are based on a subscription model where we handle the initial custom application setup, hosting, and ongoing administration for a flat monthly or yearly fee.
    - label: Can I move from Community to a Managed plan?
      content: Absolutely. If you've started with the open-source version and want us to take over the administration, hosting, and maintenance of your application, we can migrate your setup seamlessly.
    - label: Is my application data secure?
      content: Security and administration are at the core of our managed plans. We handle all software security patches, provide encrypted database environments, and perform daily backups to ensure your application remains healthy and safe.
    - label: How do I request new features?
      content: Our 'Managed Pro' plan is designed for applications that need active evolution. It includes routine feature tweaks as part of the administration service. For major architectural changes, we can discuss how to incorporate them into your managed plan. Contact clifordpereira@gmail.com for more details.
